  text: 'A character equipped with this Artifact set will obtain the Curiosity effect
    in the following conditions: When on the field, the character gains 1 stack after
    hitting an opponent with a Geo attack, triggering a maximum of once every 0.3s.
    When off the field, the character gains 1 stack every 3s. Curiosity can stack
    up to 4 times, each providing 6% DEF and a 6% Geo DMG Bonus. When 6 seconds pass
    without gaining a Curiosity stack, 1 stack is lost.'
